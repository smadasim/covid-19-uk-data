The majority of deaths reported here occurred in hospital settings, however a proportion occurred in care home settings. The figures do not include individuals who may have died from COVID-19 but who were not confirmed by laboratory testing. The true number of COVID-19 deaths will be higher. The Office for National Statistics reports on both suspected and confirmed COVID-19 deaths in England and Wales using data available on completion of the death registration process.",,,,,,,,,,

,,Deaths by LHB,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Deaths suspected to be caused by COVID-19 in people who have tested positive for COVID-19, shown by Local Health Board of residence. Figures for some health boards will be suppressed if the number of deaths is 5 or lower, in order to prevent individual deaths from being identifiable. These figures only include deaths occurring in individuals who were laboratory confirmed with COVID-19. The majority of deaths reported here occurred in hospital settings, however a proportion occurred in care home settings. The figures do not include individuals who may have died from COVID-19 but who were not confirmed by laboratory testing. The true number of COVID-19 deaths will be higher.

,,Total tests authorised,,,,,,,,,,
,,"This is a retrospective time series of the total number of test results authorised on any given day. This is provided as a proxy measure for the number of tests carried out each day, although on occasion authorisation of test results may happen later than the date that the test was carried out. These figures are at individual test level rather than patient level or episode level. Patients who provide multiple samples which are tested will be counted multiple times. Data are provisional and subject to retrospective changes due to ongoing quality assurance. Data are presented for calendar dates rather than 24 hour periods ending at 1pm, and as such will differ from historical daily headline summaries.",,,,,,,,,,
